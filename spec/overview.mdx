description: 'OSSASAI normative requirements, conformance criteria, and framework structure'
---

## Abstract

This document constitutes the **normative specification** for the Open Security Standard for Agentic Systems (OSSASAI). It defines the formal requirements, conformance criteria, and verification procedures for securing AI agent runtimes. The specification employs RFC 2119/8174 terminology to distinguish mandatory, recommended, and optional requirements across three assurance levels.

<Note>
**Normative Language:** The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).
</Note>

## Terminology and Definitions

The following terms have specific meanings within OSSASAI:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | A software system that accepts natural language inputs and executes actions via tool interfaces |
| **Tool** | A programmatic interface that enables an agent to perform actions with real-world consequences |
| **Control Plane** | Administrative interfaces for agent configuration, monitoring, and governance |
| **Trust Boundary** | A logical demarcation where data or control flow crosses security domains |
| **Coercion Attack** | An attack that manipulates an agent into unintended actions without exploiting software vulnerabilities |
| **Profile** | An ecosystem-specific mapping of OSSASAI controls to concrete platform configurations |
| **Operator** | A human user with administrative authority over agent configuration and behavior |
| **Peer** | An entity (human or automated) that interacts with an agent through its input interfaces |

## Scope

### Systems In Scope

OSSASAI applies to **tool-enabled AI agent systems** that satisfy the following criteria:

1. Accept natural language or structured inputs from potentially untrusted sources
2. Execute actions with real-world consequences via tool interfaces
3. Maintain persistent state across interactions (sessions, memory, credentials)
4. Operate with some degree of autonomy in decision-making

**Exemplar System Categories:**

| Category | Examples | Applicable Boundaries |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Conversational Agents | Slack bots, Discord bots, Teams integrations | B1, B2, B4 |
| Enterprise Copilots | SaaS integrations, API connectors, workflow automation | B1, B2, B3, B4 |
| Multi-Agent Systems | Orchestrated agents, shared memory architectures | All boundaries |
| Development Assistants | AI coding tools, IDE integrations | B2, B3, B4 |
| Autonomous Agents | Web browsing agents, task automation | All boundaries |
| Agent Frameworks | LangChain, AutoGPT, custom implementations | All boundaries |

### Systems Out of Scope

OSSASAI does **not** address:

- **Model-level safety**: Alignment, constitutional AI, output harmlessness (covered by AI safety research)
- **Training security**: Data poisoning, model theft, training infrastructure (covered by ML security)
- **General software security**: Buffer overflows, SQL injection, memory corruption (covered by OWASP, CWE)
- **Organizational governance**: AI ethics policies, responsible use frameworks (covered by IEEE, ISO/IEC)

<Info>
OSSASAI complements these domains by focusing specifically on **runtime security controls** at the agent-tool interface—the operational layer where theoretical risks manifest as real-world incidents.

## Conformance Framework

### Assurance Level Architecture

OSSASAI defines three conformance levels representing graduated security requirements. Each level builds upon the previous, with L3 representing the most comprehensive security posture.

### Level Selection Criteria

Organizations SHOULD select assurance levels based on deployment risk factors:

| Risk Factor | L1 Indicator | L2 Indicator | L3 Indicator |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Network Exposure** | Loopback only | LAN/VPN/Tailnet | Public internet |
| **User Population** | Single operator | Known team | Multi-tenant/public |
| **Tool Capabilities** | Read-only, sandboxed | Limited write access | Full system access |
| **Data Sensitivity** | Non-sensitive | Internal business | Regulated/PII/secrets |
| **Autonomy Level** | Human-in-loop always | Approval for sensitive | Autonomous operation |
| **Attack Surface** | Minimal integrations | Standard connectors | Plugin ecosystem |

### Conformance Requirements

To claim conformance to an OSSASAI assurance level, an implementation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mandatory Requirements" icon="check">
**All claimed levels:**

1. **MUST** implement all controls designated REQUIRED at the claimed level
2. **MUST** implement all REQUIRED controls from lower levels (cumulative)
3. **MUST** provide verifiable evidence of control implementation
4. **MUST** pass automated verification procedures for verifiable controls
5. **MUST** document any control exceptions with risk justification
6. **MUST NOT** disable security controls without operator acknowledgment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recommended Requirements" icon="thumbs-up">
**For robust conformance:**

1. **SHOULD** implement RECOMMENDED controls at the claimed level
2. **SHOULD** conduct periodic conformance re-verification
3. **SHOULD** maintain evidence retention for audit purposes
4. **SHOULD** document configuration changes affecting security posture
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Partial Conformance" icon="circle-half-stroke">
**Implementations not meeting full requirements:**

1. **MUST NOT** claim conformance to levels where requirements are unmet
2. **MAY** claim conformance to a lower level if all requirements are satisfied
3. **MAY** publish a conformance statement detailing implemented controls
4. **SHOULD** document a remediation plan for unmet controls
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Normative Principles

OSSASAI controls are derived from five foundational security principles. These principles inform control design and provide interpretive guidance for edge cases.

### GEN-01: Security by Default

**Requirement Level:** MUST (All Levels)

Implementations MUST be secure in their default configuration. Security features MUST NOT require explicit opt-in by users.

**Rationale:** Secure defaults reduce the likelihood of accidental misconfiguration—a primary driver of agent security incidents (Greshake et al., 2023). Users should achieve baseline protection without security expertise.

**Verification:**
- Review default configuration files for security-relevant settings
- Verify that all controls are enabled without user intervention
- Test that fresh installations pass automated security audits

**References:** NIST SP 800-123 (Guide to General Server Security), CIS Benchmark methodology

---

### GEN-02: Fail Secure

**Requirement Level:** MUST (All Levels)

Implementations MUST fail to a secure state when errors occur. Failures MUST NOT result in security control bypass.

**Rationale:** Error handling paths are common exploit targets. A system that fails open (permissive) creates opportunities for attackers to trigger controlled failures.

**Verification:**
- Inject faults in authentication, authorization, and sandboxing subsystems
- Verify that security controls remain enforced during error conditions
- Test that partial system failures do not expose protected resources

**References:** OWASP Secure Coding Practices, IEEE 1012-2016 (Software Verification and Validation)

---

### GEN-03: Principle of Least Privilege

**Requirement Level:** MUST (All Levels)

Implementations MUST operate with the minimum privileges necessary for intended functionality. Elevated privileges MUST be requested only when required and MUST be relinquished immediately after use.

**Rationale:** Overprivileged components amplify the impact of successful attacks. Least privilege limits lateral movement and blast radius (Saltzer & Schroeder, 1975).

**Verification:**
- Audit runtime privilege levels for all agent components
- Verify privilege escalation follows explicit request patterns
- Test that elevated privileges are time-bounded and scoped

**References:** NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 (Least Privilege), Saltzer & Schroeder (1975) "Protection of Information in Computer Systems"

---

### GEN-04: Defense in Depth

**Requirement Level:** SHOULD (L1), MUST (L2/L3)

Implementations SHOULD (L1) / MUST (L2/L3) implement multiple independent layers of security controls. No single control failure SHOULD result in complete security bypass.

**Rationale:** Layered defenses provide resilience against individual control failures. Defense in depth acknowledges that all controls have failure modes (NSA, "Defense in Depth: A Practical Strategy").

**Verification:**
- Analyze control dependencies and identify single points of failure
- Verify that redundant controls exist for critical security functions
- Test that disabling individual controls does not fully compromise security

**References:** NSA Defense in Depth Strategy, NIST SP 800-53 SC-3 (Security Function Isolation)

---

### GEN-05: Audit Logging

**Requirement Level:** SHOULD (L1), MUST (L2/L3)

Implementations SHOULD (L1) / MUST (L2/L3) maintain comprehensive audit logs of security-relevant events. Logs MUST be tamper-evident at L3.

**Rationale:** Audit trails enable incident investigation, compliance verification, and forensic analysis. Tamper-evident logging prevents attackers from covering their tracks.

**Verification:**
- Verify audit log generation for security-relevant events
- Test log retention mechanisms and access controls
- At L3: Verify cryptographic integrity protection for audit logs

**References:** NIST SP 800-92 (Guide to Computer Security Log Management), SOC 2 Type II CC6.1

### Control Domains

OSSASAI organizes controls into seven domains aligned with the trust boundary model:

| Domain | Prefix | Boundary | Control Focus | Control Count |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Control Plane** | CP | B2 | Configuration, admin access, exposure | 4 |
| **Identity & Session** | ID | B1 | Authentication, pairing, isolation | 3 |
| **Tool Blast Radius** | TB | B3 | Tool governance, privileges, sandboxing | 4 |
| **Local State** | LS | B4 | Secrets, logging, memory, retention | 4 |
| **Supply Chain** | SC | B3 | Plugin trust, inventory, pinning | 2 |
| **Formal Verification** | FV | All | High-assurance proofs (optional) | 3 |
| **Network Security** | NS | B2, B3 | Transport, endpoints, egress | 4 |

## Trust Model

### Trust Boundary Definitions

OSSASAI defines four canonical trust boundaries representing security-relevant interfaces in agent architectures:

| Boundary | ID | Security Function | Threat Surface |
|----------|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| **Inbound Identity** | B1 | Input validation, peer verification, coercion resistance | Untrusted senders, prompt injection, social engineering |
| **Control Plane** | B2 | Authentication, authorization, exposure control | Admin UI/API/CLI, configuration interfaces |
| **Tool Boundary** | B3 | Least privilege, sandboxing, approval gates, egress control | Tool invocation, capability grants, external connectors |
| **Local State** | B4 | Secrets protection, redaction, retention, memory safety | Credentials, logs, memory, transcripts, caches |

### Trust Assumptions

OSSASAI makes explicit trust assumptions to bound the security model:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trusted Components" icon="shield-check">
**The following are assumed trustworthy:**

1. **Operating System Kernel**: The underlying OS kernel is correctly implemented and not compromised
2. **Hardware Platform**: Physical hardware operates as designed (no hardware trojans or supply chain compromise)
3. **Cryptographic Primitives**: Standard cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA-256, ECDSA) are secure when correctly implemented
4. **Operator Intent**: The human operator acts with legitimate intent toward the system (insider threat modeled separately)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Untrusted Components" icon="shield-exclamation">
**The following are NOT assumed trustworthy:**

1. **External Inputs**: All inputs from peers, channels, and external systems
2. **Network Infrastructure**: Network paths between components (require TLS)
3. **Third-Party Plugins**: Extensions from external sources (require verification)
4. **Retrieved Content**: Data from external APIs, web pages, or databases
5. **Model Outputs**: LLM-generated content (may be influenced by adversarial inputs)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Threat Model Integration

OSSASAI controls address the threat model defined in [Threat Model Overview](/threat-model/overview), including:

- **Adversary Classes A1–A5**: From opportunistic to nation-state
- **AI Agent Threat Taxonomy (AATT)**: Coercion, capability escalation, context manipulation, supply chain
- **STRIDE Categories**: Applied to agent-specific attack surfaces

## Profile Mechanism

A **Profile** provides an ecosystem-specific mapping of OSSASAI controls to concrete platform configurations, enabling vendor-neutral requirements with implementation-specific guidance.

### Profile Requirements

A conformant Profile MUST include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Profile ID** | Unique identifier following pattern `OSSASAI-PROFILE-[PLATFORM]-[NAME]-[VERSION]` |
| **Control Mapping** | Table mapping each OSSASAI control to platform configuration |
| **Evidence Procedures** | How to generate required evidence artifacts |
| **Platform Extensions** | Additional platform-specific controls (if any) |
| **Conformance Recipes** | Step-by-step deployment guides for L1/L2/L3 |
| **Verification Tooling** | Platform-specific audit commands and scripts |

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Versioning and Evolution

### Semantic Versioning

OSSASAI follows semantic versioning (SemVer) for specification releases:

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- Major versions indicate breaking changes
- Minor versions add controls or expand coverage
- Patch versions contain editorial corrections

### Change Classification

| Change Type | Version Impact | Transition Period |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Add new control | Minor | Immediate |
| Elevate SHOULD to MUST | Major | 6-month grace period |
| Demote MUST to SHOULD | Major | Immediate |
| Add new assurance level | Major | 12-month transition |
| Modify verification procedure | Minor | 3-month transition |
| Editorial clarification | Patch | Immediate |

### Backward Compatibility

Implementations conformant to OSSASAI version X.Y.Z:

- **MUST** remain conformant for all X.Y.* releases
- **SHOULD** achieve conformance to minor version updates within 6 months
- **MUST** achieve conformance to major version updates within grace period
