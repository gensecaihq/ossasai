## A

**Agent System**
: A runtime that accepts input (messages/events), invokes model(s), and may execute tool actions. Includes chat/DM-based personal assistants, enterprise copilots, multi-agent runtimes, and AI coding assistants.

**Adversary Class**
: Classification of threat actors by capability and access level (A1-A5). Ranges from untrusted senders (A1) to supply-chain adversaries (A5).

**Allowlist**
: Explicit list of permitted items (commands, paths, hosts). OSSASAI uses allowlisting as a primary restriction mechanism.

**Assurance Level**
: OSSASAI conformance tier (L1, L2, L3) representing increasing security rigor and control requirements.

## B

**B1 (Inbound Identity Boundary)**
: Trust boundary for untrusted senders, channels, and web inputs. Primary prompt injection / coercion surface.

**B2 (Control Plane Boundary)**
: Trust boundary for admin access to configuration and approvals (UI/API/CLI).

**B3 (Tool Boundary)**
: Trust boundary for tool execution, privilege, and approval flow.

**B4 (Local State Boundary)**
: Trust boundary for credentials, secrets, memory, logs, transcripts, and caches.

**Blast Radius**
: The extent of potential damage from a security incident. Quantified based on filesystem scope, capabilities, data sensitivity, and persistence potential.

## C

**Capability**
: A permission or ability granted to an agent. Capabilities are explicitly granted and constrained by the permission model.

**Coercion Attack**
: Attack that manipulates the AI agent into performing unintended actions. Includes prompt injection, social engineering, and context manipulation.

**Conformance**
: Meeting the requirements of a specified OSSASAI assurance level. Full conformance requires implementing all MUST controls for that level.

**Control**
: A security requirement with specific implementation and verification criteria. Identified by OSSASAI prefix, domain prefix, and number (e.g., OSSASAI-TB-01).

**Control Plane**
: Admin UI/API/CLI used to configure, observe, approve, or operate the agent.

## D

**Data Plane**
: Inbound/outbound message channels and tool I/O.

**Denylist**
: Explicit list of prohibited items. Used for dangerous command patterns and known malicious content.

**Domain**
: A category of related security controls. OSSASAI defines seven domains: CP, ID, TB, LS, SC, FV, NS.

## E

**Evidence**
: Documentation demonstrating control implementation. Required for compliance verification.

**Extension / Plugin**
: Third-party code or configuration that expands agent capabilities. Subject to supply chain controls.

## F

**Formal Verification**
: Mathematical proof of security properties. Optional but encouraged for L3 deployments.

## I

**Instruction Smuggling**
: Attack where malicious instructions are embedded in retrieved content (memory, RAG) to override system behavior.

## L

**L1 (Local-First Baseline)**
: OSSASAI assurance level for single operator, local admin surface, minimal exposure. Target: hobby/personal or developer workstation.

**L2 (Network-Aware)**
: OSSASAI assurance level for remote access (LAN/tailnet/VPS), higher inbound risk. Target: remote control plane, team usage.

**L3 (High-Risk Runtime)**
: OSSASAI assurance level for tool-rich, plugin-heavy, multi-user/multi-tenant deployments. Target: enterprise-like exposure, many connectors, delegated actions.

**Least Privilege**
: Security principle requiring minimal permissions needed for operation. Core principle of OSSASAI tool governance.

## M

**Memory Poisoning**
: Attack that corrupts agent memory or context to influence future behavior. Includes retrieval attacks and instruction smuggling.

**MUST / SHOULD / MAY**
: RFC 2119 requirement levels used in OSSASAI. MUST indicates absolute requirement, SHOULD indicates strong recommendation, MAY indicates optional.

## O

**OCSAS (OpenClaw Security Assurance Standard)**
: The official OpenClaw implementation profile for OSSASAI. Maps OSSASAI controls to OpenClaw's configuration and CLI tooling.

**OSSASAI**
: Open Security Standard for Agentic Systems. A vendor-neutral, "OWASP-like" global security standard for AI agent runtimes.

**OSSASAI Top 10**
: Primary failure modes prioritized by OSSASAI: (1) Prompt injection → tool misuse, (2) Over-privileged tools, (3) Exposed control plane, (4) Session boundary collapse, (5) Secrets leakage, (6) Unsafe browsing/connectors, (7) Extension supply chain, (8) Memory poisoning, (9) Missing auditability, (10) Unsafe defaults + drift.

## P

**Pairing**
: Verification process for new peers before granting tool access. Prevents unauthorized tool execution.

**Profile**
: Implementation-specific mapping of OSSASAI controls to a concrete platform. Example: OCSAS for OpenClaw.

**Prompt Injection**
: Attack that manipulates agent behavior through crafted input. Primary vector for coercion attacks.

## R

**Redaction**
: Removal or masking of sensitive data from logs, transcripts, and outputs.

**RFC 2119**
: IETF standard defining requirement levels (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) used in OSSASAI specification.

## S

**Sandbox**
: Isolated execution environment with restricted capabilities. Used for untrusted contexts.

**Session**
: A logical conversation or task context for one or more users/peers. Subject to isolation controls.

**Session Boundary Collapse**
: Security failure where sessions share context inappropriately, leading to cross-user leakage.

## T

**Tool**
: An action interface with side effects (e.g., filesystem, shell, browser automation, SaaS APIs).

**Trust Boundary**
: Interface where trust assumptions change. OSSASAI defines four canonical boundaries (B1-B4).

## V

**Verification Procedure**
: Documented method for testing control implementation. Each OSSASAI control includes verification procedures.
