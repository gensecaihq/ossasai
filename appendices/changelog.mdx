## Version History

### OSSASAI v0.1.0 (January 2025)

**Initial Public Release**

This is the initial public release of the Open Security Standard for Agentic Systems (OSSASAI).

#### Framework Structure
- Established three assurance levels: L1 (Local-First Baseline), L2 (Network-Aware), L3 (High-Risk Runtime)
- Defined four canonical trust boundaries (B1-B4)
- Created ~20 security controls with verification procedures using RFC 2119 language

#### Threat Model
- Defined OSSASAI Top 10 failure modes for agentic systems
- Established five adversary classes (A1-A5)
- Created trust boundary model (B1: Inbound Identity, B2: Control Plane, B3: Tool Boundary, B4: Local State)

#### Control Domains
- **CP** (Control Plane): 4 controls
- **ID** (Identity/Session): 3 controls
- **TB** (Tool Blast Radius): 4 controls
- **LS** (Local State): 4 controls
- **SC** (Supply Chain): 2 controls
- **FV** (Formal Verification): 3 controls (optional)
- **NS** (Network Security): 4 controls

#### Profile Mechanism
- Introduced profile mechanism for ecosystem-specific mappings
- Published OCSAS (OpenClaw Security Assurance Standard) as the first implementation profile

#### Documentation
- Complete specification using RFC 2119 language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)

## Migration Guide

### From Earlier Drafts

If migrating from earlier draft versions:

1. Control IDs have been prefixed with `OSSASAI-` (e.g., `CP-01` → `OSSASAI-CP-01`)
2. Some controls have been reorganized to align with trust boundaries
3. Evidence requirements have been standardized across all controls

## Contributing

OSSASAI is an open community standard. Changes are proposed via:

1. **Issues**: Report gaps, errors, or suggest improvements
2. **Pull Requests**: Propose specific changes with rationale
3. **Discussions**: Broader architectural discussions

All changes undergo community review before inclusion in the specification.
