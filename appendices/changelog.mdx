## Version History

### OSSASAI v0.2.0 (January 2025)

**Industry-Ready Release**

This release addresses critical gaps identified during the industry-readiness review, adding missing controls, fixing tooling bugs, and improving documentation completeness.

#### New Controls

**General Domain (GEN) - 5 new controls:**
- **OSSASAI-GEN-01**: Security by Default
- **OSSASAI-GEN-02**: Fail Secure
- **OSSASAI-GEN-03**: Principle of Least Privilege
- **OSSASAI-GEN-04**: Defense in Depth
- **OSSASAI-GEN-05**: Audit Logging

**Supply Chain Domain (SC) - 1 new control:**
- **OSSASAI-SC-03**: Artifact Signing and Attestation

#### Control Catalog Updates
- Total controls increased from 24 to 30
- Updated control matrix with GEN domain
- Added OSSASAI Top 10 mappings for new controls
- Expanded evidence requirements table

#### Tooling Improvements

**ossasai-audit.sh v2.0.0:**
- Implemented verification for all 30 controls (previously only 4)
- Added cross-platform support (macOS/Linux)
- Removed "assumed pass" behavior - all controls actively verified
- Added GEN, SC-03, and remaining control checks
- Improved error handling and reporting
- Added WARN and SKIP status support

**ossasai-report.py v2.0.0:**
- Fixed logic error in compliance status (line 48)
- Added XML escaping for JUnit output (security fix)
- Added YAML escaping for special characters
- Added optional PDF report generation
- Improved error handling and validation

**ossasai-github-action.yml v2.0.0:**
- Removed dummy JSON creation on failure (security fix)
- Set `fail-on-error: true` for proper CI integration
- Added proper audit script validation
- Improved PR commenting with update support
- Better error messaging and failure enforcement

#### Documentation Updates
- Created `/profiles/` directory with overview and OpenClaw profile
- Added `/appendices/schemas/evidence-manifest.schema.json`
- Fixed cross-platform issues in hardening checklist
- Fixed curl|bash antipattern in CI/CD documentation
- Updated control overview with GEN domain
- Expanded L1/L2/L3 control lists

#### Breaking Changes
- Audit script now returns FAIL for unverified controls (previously PASS)
- Control count increased - update compliance targets accordingly
- GitHub Action now fails builds on compliance failures by default

### OSSASAI v0.1.0 (January 2025)

**Initial Public Release**

This is the initial public release of the Open Security Standard for Agentic Systems (OSSASAI).

#### Framework Structure
- Established three assurance levels: L1 (Local-First Baseline), L2 (Network-Aware), L3 (High-Risk Runtime)
- Defined four canonical trust boundaries (B1-B4)
- Created 24 security controls with verification procedures using RFC 2119 language

#### Threat Model
- Defined OSSASAI Top 10 failure modes for agentic systems
- Established five adversary classes (A1-A5)
- Created trust boundary model (B1: Inbound Identity, B2: Control Plane, B3: Tool Boundary, B4: Local State)

#### Control Domains
- **CP** (Control Plane): 4 controls
- **ID** (Identity/Session): 3 controls
- **TB** (Tool Blast Radius): 4 controls
- **LS** (Local State): 4 controls
- **SC** (Supply Chain): 2 controls
- **FV** (Formal Verification): 3 controls (optional)
- **NS** (Network Security): 4 controls

#### Profile Mechanism
- Introduced profile mechanism for ecosystem-specific mappings
- Published OCSAS (OpenClaw Security Assurance Standard) as the first implementation profile

#### Documentation
- Complete specification using RFC 2119 language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- Implementation guides for all assurance levels
- Verification procedures for each control
- Standards mapping to OWASP ASVS, NIST, CIS, SLSA

#### Tooling
- `ossasai-audit.sh` - Automated compliance verification
- `ossasai-report.py` - Compliance report generator
- GitHub Actions workflow template

## Planned Changes

### OSSASAI v0.2.0 (Planned)

- Additional controls for multi-agent systems
- Enhanced MCP server security guidance
- Memory poisoning detection controls
- Expanded retrieval/RAG security guidance

### OSSASAI v1.0.0 (Future)

- Stable control catalog
- Expanded formal verification requirements
- Hardware security module integration guide
- Multi-tenant deployment patterns

## Migration Guide

### From Earlier Drafts

If migrating from earlier draft versions:

1. Control IDs have been prefixed with `OSSASAI-` (e.g., `CP-01` → `OSSASAI-CP-01`)
2. Some controls have been reorganized to align with trust boundaries
3. Evidence requirements have been standardized across all controls

---

## Contributing

OSSASAI is an open community standard. Changes are proposed via:

1. **Issues**: Report gaps, errors, or suggest improvements
2. **Pull Requests**: Propose specific changes with rationale
3. **Discussions**: Broader architectural discussions

All changes undergo community review before inclusion in the specification.
