## Playbook: Prompt Injection Attack

### Detection
- Unusual command patterns in logs
- Security control bypass attempts
- Unexpected file access or command execution

### Containment
1. Terminate affected session immediately
2. Block source IP/user if applicable
3. Preserve session logs and context
4. Enable enhanced monitoring

### Investigation
1. Review session history for injection point
2. Identify what actions were taken
3. Determine scope of compromise
4. Check for data exfiltration

### Eradication
1. Patch injection vector if found
2. Update input validation rules
3. Add detection signatures

### Recovery
1. Restore from clean state if needed
2. Re-enable services with monitoring
3. Verify controls are functioning

## Playbook: Sandbox Escape

### Detection
- File access outside sandbox boundaries
- Symlink following alerts
- Path traversal patterns

### Containment
1. **CRITICAL**: Terminate all sessions immediately
2. Disable AI assistant service
3. Isolate affected systems
4. Preserve forensic evidence

### Investigation
1. Identify escape mechanism
2. Determine all accessed files
3. Check for persistence mechanisms
4. Assess data exposure

### Eradication
1. Patch escape vulnerability
2. Remove any persistence
3. Reset compromised credentials
4. Update sandbox rules

### Recovery
1. Redeploy from trusted image
2. Rotate all credentials
3. Re-enable with enhanced monitoring

## Playbook: Credential Exposure

### Detection
- Sensitive file access alerts
- Secret patterns in output logs
- Credential usage from unexpected location

### Containment
1. Immediately rotate exposed credentials
2. Revoke active sessions using those credentials
3. Block external access temporarily

### Investigation
1. Identify which credentials exposed
2. Determine exposure method
3. Check for credential usage
4. Assess downstream impact

### Eradication
1. Remove credentials from accessible locations
2. Update sensitive file patterns
3. Enhance output redaction

### Recovery
1. Deploy new credentials
2. Update dependent services
3. Enable credential monitoring

## Playbook: Malicious Plugin

### Detection
- Unexpected network connections
- Plugin accessing unauthorized resources
- Anomalous plugin behavior

### Containment
1. Disable suspected plugin immediately
2. Block plugin network access
3. Isolate affected sessions

### Investigation
1. Analyze plugin code
2. Review plugin permissions used
3. Check for data exfiltration
4. Identify installation source

### Eradication
1. Remove malicious plugin
2. Block plugin source
3. Update plugin allowlist

### Recovery
1. Restore clean plugin configuration
2. Re-enable plugin verification
3. Scan for other compromised plugins

## Playbook: Data Exfiltration

### Detection
- Large outbound data transfers
- Connections to unknown destinations
- Encoded data in requests

### Containment
1. Block egress to suspicious destinations
2. Terminate affected sessions
3. Enable full packet capture

### Investigation
1. Identify exfiltration destination
2. Determine data exfiltrated
3. Find exfiltration mechanism
4. Assess data sensitivity

### Eradication
1. Block exfiltration vector
2. Update egress rules
3. Enhance DLP controls

### Recovery
1. Assess breach notification requirements
2. Implement enhanced monitoring
3. Review data access patterns
