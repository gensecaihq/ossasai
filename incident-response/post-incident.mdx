| 10:00 | Alert triggered |
| 10:05 | Analyst begins investigation |
| 10:15 | Incident confirmed, escalated |
| 10:30 | Containment actions taken |
| 11:00 | Root cause identified |
| 12:15 | Recovery complete |

## Impact
- Sessions affected: 5
- Data potentially exposed: None confirmed
- Service disruption: 45 minutes

## Root Cause
[Description of root cause]

## What Went Well
1. Detection was rapid (5 minutes)
2. Containment was effective
3. Communication was clear

## What Could Be Improved
1. Playbook didn't cover this scenario
2. Recovery took longer than target
3. Some logs were incomplete

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due | Status |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| Update playbook | Security | 2025-01-30 | Open |
| Add monitoring | Ops | 2025-02-01 | Open |
| Fix logging gap | Dev | 2025-01-25 | In Progress |

## Control Improvements
- [ ] Add detection for [specific pattern]
- [ ] Strengthen control [ID]
- [ ] Update policy [name]
```

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Mean Time to Detect | < 15 min | |
| Mean Time to Contain | < 30 min | |
| Mean Time to Recover | < 4 hours | |
| Playbook Coverage | 100% | |
| Action Item Completion | 100% in 30 days | |

## Continuous Improvement

### Quarterly Review

- Review all incidents from quarter
- Identify trends and patterns
- Update threat model if needed
- Assess control effectiveness
- Plan improvements

### Annual Assessment

- Full incident response exercise
- Tabletop exercises for new scenarios
- Third-party assessment of IR capability
- Program maturity evaluation
