description: 'A vendor-neutral security framework for AI agent systems'

## Welcome to OSSASAI

**OSSASAI** (Open Security Standard for Agentic Systems) is a vendor-neutral, community-driven security framework designed specifically for AI agent systems that interact with external tools, filesystems, networks, and users.

<Note>
**Design Philosophy:** "Access control before intelligence." Most AI agent security failures are not sophisticated exploits—they're cases where "someone messaged the bot and the bot did what they asked." OSSASAI's stance: Identity first, scope next, model last.
</Note>

## Why OSSASAI?

Traditional security frameworks (OWASP, NIST, CIS) address general application and infrastructure security but don't adequately cover the unique threat landscape of AI agents:

- **Prompt injection attacks** that manipulate agent behavior
- **Tool abuse** where legitimate capabilities are misused
- **Context poisoning** through malicious conversation history
- **Identity confusion** in multi-user messaging environments
- **Capability escalation** through chained tool invocations

OSSASAI provides a structured approach to these AI-specific threats while building on established security principles.

## Assurance Levels

OSSASAI defines three assurance levels based on deployment context and risk tolerance:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **L1** | Local-First | Single-user, loopback-only deployments with minimal attack surface |
| **L2** | Network-Aware | Multi-user deployments with LAN/VPN exposure |
| **L3** | High-Assurance | Production deployments with public exposure or regulatory requirements |

## Trust Boundaries

The framework defines four trust boundaries that must be secured:

| Boundary | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **B1** | Inbound Identity | Message sources and sender verification |
| **B2** | Control Plane | Administrative interfaces and configuration |
| **B3** | Tool Governance | Capability restrictions and sandboxing |
| **B4** | Local State | Secrets, logs, and persistent data |

## Control Domains

| Domain | ID | Controls | Description |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| General | GEN | 5 | Security by default, fail secure, least privilege, defense in depth, audit logging |
| Control Plane | CP | 4 | Gateway exposure, authentication, proxy trust |
| Identity & Session | ID | 3 | Peer verification, session isolation, group policies |
| Tool Blast Radius | TB | 4 | Least privilege, approval gates, sandboxing |
| Local State | LS | 4 | Secrets protection, log redaction, retention |
| Supply Chain | SC | 3 | Plugin trust, reproducible builds, artifact signing |
| Formal Verification | FV | 3 | Security invariants, testing, CI integration |
| Network Security | NS | 4 | TLS, certificates, API security |

## Implementation Profiles

OSSASAI is designed to be implemented by specific AI agent platforms through **implementation profiles**. Each profile maps OSSASAI controls to platform-specific features, configurations, and tooling.

### Profile Registry

The [Profile Registry](/profiles/registry) provides:
- Central catalog of all OSSASAI profiles
- Webhook notifications when framework changes affect profiles
- Compatibility tracking between OSSASAI and profile versions
- API endpoints for profile management

### Available Profiles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="OCSAS - OpenClaw Security Assurance Standard" icon="terminal" href="/profiles/openclaw">
    Official implementation profile for OpenClaw AI agent runtime. Complete control mapping with CLI-based verification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create a Profile" icon="plus" href="/profiles/overview">
    Create an implementation profile for your platform. Register with the registry to receive framework change notifications.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

1. **Understand the threat model** - Review [adversary classes](/threat-model/adversary-classes) and [AI agent threats](/threat-model/ai-agent-threats)
2. **Choose your assurance level** - Based on deployment context, select [L1, L2, or L3](/spec/assurance-levels)
3. **Review applicable controls** - Identify controls required for your assurance level
4. **Implement controls** - Follow implementation guides or use a platform-specific profile
5. **Verify compliance** - Use automated auditing and evidence collection

## Standards Alignment

OSSASAI maps to established security frameworks:

| Standard | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| OWASP ASVS v4.0 | Authentication, session management, access control |
| NIST SP 800-53 | AC, AU, CM, IA, SC control families |
| NIST AI RMF | AI-specific risk management |
| CIS Controls v8 | Controls 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16 |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Tactic and technique mapping |

## Contributing

OSSASAI is an open standard. Contributions are welcome:

- **Framework improvements** - Submit issues and PRs to the [OSSASAI repository](https://github.com/gensecaihq/ossasai)
- **Implementation profiles** - Create profiles for additional AI agent platforms
- **Security research** - Report vulnerabilities and contribute threat intelligence

## Version

**OSSASAI v0.2.0** - January 2025

This release includes 30 security controls, a complete profile registry system, and production-ready tooling. The framework will continue to evolve based on community feedback and emerging AI agent security research.
